# Create calculate_insurance_cost() function below:


def calculate_insurance_cost(name, age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker):
    estimated_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + \
        425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
    print("The estimated insurance cost for " + name + " is " + str(estimated_cost)
          + " dollars.")
    return estimated_cost


# Estimate Maria's insurance cost
maria_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(
    name="Maria", age=28, sex=0, bmi=26.2, num_of_children=3, smoker=0)

# Estimate Omar's insurance cost
omar_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(
    name="Omar", age=35, sex=1, bmi=22.2, num_of_children=1, smoker=0)

# Estimate my insurance cost
my_insurance_cost = calculate_insurance_cost(
    name="me", age=35, sex=1, bmi=36, num_of_children=2, smoker=0)
